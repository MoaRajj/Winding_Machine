# "Winding Machine"
## Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to precisely pull fiber strands at an adjustable speed.
## Methodology:
To achieve this objective, an Arduino Uno was employed to program the system. The system features a roller holder with adjustable speed capabilities, allowing it to move both right and left at three different selectable speeds. These speeds are conveniently set using three On-Off switches. Additionally, limit switches have been strategically placed on each side of the holder to facilitate the reversal of the motor's direction.
## Results:
This system empowers the user with the ability to finely control the roller holder's speed, aligning it with the desired pulling speed. This ensures that the fiber strands are uniformly distributed across the roller.
## Challenges:
A notable challenge encountered during this project was the need to effectively detect the state of the limit switches in order to trigger the motor's directional change.
## Relevance:
Similar to my previous projects, this endeavor resonates with my passion for automating and streamlining mundane tasks into efficient and controlled systems.
